# SynoAI
A Synology Surveillance Station notification system utilising DeepStack AI, inspired by Christopher Adams' [sssAI](https://github.com/Christofo/sssAI) implementation.

The aim of the solution is to reduce the noise generated by Synology Surveillance Station's motion detection by routing all motion events via a [Deepstack](https://deepstack.cc/) docker image to look for particular objects, e.g. people.

The problem with sssAI that this project is designed to solve is that it relies on the Synology notification system still in order to send motion alerts. Due to the delay between fetching the snapshot, processing the image using the AI and requesting the alert, it means that the image attached to the Synology notification is sometimes 5-10 seconds after the motion alert was originally trigger.

SynoAI aims to solve this problem by side-stepping the Synology notifications entirely by allowing other notification systems to be used.

## Supported AIs

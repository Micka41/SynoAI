# Build the docker image
docker build -t synoai:0.1 .
    Where 0.1 is the tag and the "." is the current working directory.

# Run the application and map the appsettings.Development.json to the actual appsettings.json
-- docker run -it --rm -v /run/desktop/mnt/host/c/Projects/GitHub/SynoAI/appsettings.Development.json:/app/appsettings.json -p 8080:80 synoai:0.1

# General docker notes
 - Added "RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgdiplus" to Docketfile, because libgdiplus doesn't exist by default
